# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-TCL-COMMANDS-SAVE-POINT-ROLL-BACK-AND-ROLL-BACK-TO-COMMANDS

AIM:

To execute Transactional Control Commands such as Commit, Rollback and Savepoint.

ALGORITHM:

STEP 1: Start the DMBS.

STEP 2: Connect to the existing database (DB)

STEP 3: Create the table with its essential attributes.

STEP 4: Insert record values into the table or perform any kind of DML operation.

STEP 5: Create the SAVE POINTs for some set of statement on the transaction of database object. 

STEP 6: Use the COMMIT command to save the effect of the previous command operation except DDL command

STEP 7: Use the ROLLBACK TO SP_LABLE / ROLLBACK command for restore the database status up to the save point

STEP 8: Check the status of the database.

STEP 9: Stop the DBMS.

THEORY:
Transaction Control Language(TCL) commands are used to manage transactions in the database.These are used to manage the changes made to the data in a table by DML statements. It also allowsstatements to be grouped together into logical transactions.

COMMIT command

COMMIT command is used to permanently save any transaction into the database.

To avoid that, we use the COMMIT command to mark the changes as permanent.

Syntax:

COMMIT;

ROLLBACK command

This command restores the database to last commited state. It is also used with

SAVEPOINT

command to jump to a savepoint in an ongoing transaction.

Syntax:

ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name;

SAVEPOINT command

SAVEPOINT command is used to temporarily save a transaction so that you can rollback to that point when ever required.

Syntax:

SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;

COMMANDS:

Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records â€“

SQL> DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE = 25;

SQL> ROLLBACK;

SQL> select * from customers

SQL> DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE = 25;

SQL> COMMIT;

SQL> select * from customers

SQL> SAVEPOINT SP1;

Savepoint created.

SQL> DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID=1;

1 row deleted.

SQL> SAVEPOINT SP2;

Savepoint created.

SQL> DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID=2;

1 row deleted.

SQL> SAVEPOINT SP3;

Savepoint created.

SQL> DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID=3;

1 row deleted.

SQL> ROLLBACK TO SP2;

Rollback complete.

SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;

+----+----------+-----+-----------+----+
| ID | NAME | AGE | ADDRESS | SALARY |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
| 2 | Khilan | 25 | Delhi | 1500.00 |
| 3 | kaushik | 23 | Kota | 2000.00 |
| 4 | Chaitali | 25 | Mumbai | 6500.00 |
| 5 | Hardik | 27 | Bhopal | 8500.00 |
| 6 | Komal | 22 | MP | 4500.00 |
| 7 | Muffy | 24 | Indore | 10000.00 |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+

6 rows selected.

RESULT:

Thus the Transactional Control Commands such as Commit, Rollback and Savepoint has been executed successfully.
